# Moon Unicode Art

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/wenxich/pen/wvjGaOL](https://codepen.io/wenxich/pen/wvjGaOL).

Used 墨黑深浅灰光白日口小 unicode characters to represent shades (in order from "darkest" shade to "brightest" shade).

Each Chinese character also has a meaning vaguely associated with its shade in this system (translated from darkest to brightest: ink, black, deep, shallow, gray, light, white, sun, opening, small).
